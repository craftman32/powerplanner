<h1>Max Effort Exercises</h1>
<div class="jumbotron">
	<p>
		I’ve taken note of your available equipment. Now, we can get into the fun part of making your cycle: choosing exercises! To begin with, let’s choose max effort movements for your max effort workouts. The max effort method is lifting a maximal weight with maximal force in an exercise, often trying to break a personal record in that exercise. This method builds maximal strength and coordination in a movement, which is very important for powerlifting. In a max effort workout, you will try to lift the most you can in a movement for one, two, or three reps, depending on the movement and its position in the macrocycle. I can offer you two options: I can automatically assign you max effort movements based on your timeframe, weaknesses, and equipment or I can show you a list of max effort movements that correspond to your weaknesses and equipment and you can pick which ones you want to use in your cycle.
