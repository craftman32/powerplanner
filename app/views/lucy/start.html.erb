		Hello there! My name is Lucy and Iâ€™ll be your guide for creating your very own powerlifting training cycle. It is very important to make a training plan before you go to the gym. After all, failing to plan is planning to fail! I will walk you through the steps of creating a training cycle for you to get stronger. Are you ready to begin?
