Hello! My name is Mike and I am making this Rails app for Grand Valley State University Student Scholar's Day 2016. I will be presenting it at 4:30pm on Wednesday, April 13th in Kirkhof room 2263.

This application provides a system for creating powerlifting training cycles based on the conjugate method. Lucy can help guide you through this process, or you can manually make your own cycle. You can also log the weights you use for your exercises so you can track your progress.

The application is live at http://tranquil-brook-10665.herokuapp.com/
